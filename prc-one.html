It is famous mostly for its long natural sandy beach. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was "Palongkee". The city has the longest uninterrupted natural beach in the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Bazar">...[see more]</a></p>
